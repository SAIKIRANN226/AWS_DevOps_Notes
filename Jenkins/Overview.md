### Session-42
- How to install Jenkins in server ?
- Installing java in Jenkins is mandatory because jenkins is developed on java only, but no need to install
  jenkins in agent (Java is enough for the agent to work).
- Jenkins-Master may not required to know everything, but agent must know everything because actual work is
  done by the agent only, however logs will be shown in Jenkins-Master.
- Jenkins port number is 8080
- What is Free-style project in Jenkins ? Nothing but creating job in Jenkins console UI.
- What is the difference between creating aws resources in aws console & through code ?
- Difference between Free-style job & Pipeline job ?
- Create a job first using Free-style and then Pipeline ?
- What is Pipeline script from SCM or GitOps ? 
- Write a RAW syntax of a Declarative pipeline ?
- What is agent in Jenkins ? How many agents are required ?
- How do you configure Master-Agent architecture in jenkins ? Manage jenkins, nodes, create node, executors,
  remote root directory, labels, launch methods, host, configure credentials, host key verification strategy. 
- Where does the entire jenkins database will be ? /var/lib/jenkins, similarly we need to create a directory
  for agent also in /home/centos/jenkins-agent (Any-name) because CentOS dont have sudo access in
  /var/lib/jenkins, it has only in home folder (or) click on question mark ? symbol, there you can see how to
  give the path.
- How many agents you are using in your company ? We are supporting multiple programming languages like java,
  python, nodesjs, .net for each language, we have 2-2 agents.
- Triggers in Jenkins pipeline ?
- Environment in Jenkins pipeline ?
- Options in Jenkins pipeline ?
- Parameters in Jenkins pipeline ?

### Session-43
- Difference between Scripted pipeline & Declarative pipeline ?
- Input option in Jenkins pipeline ?
- Create a Jenkins file for infra like vpc. Use terraform init, plan, apply. Use input option before apply.
  Since this pipeline is running on agent. We need to install terraform command & aws credentials (aws
  configure) in agent server. While aws configure dont take sudo access because jenkins-master is connecting
  to agent using centos. Search in google like install terraform linux
- To get colours we have a plugin called ansiColor('xterm') in options itself. So install this plugin in
  manage jenkins, plugins aswel as write code in script in options. If plugins are not working even after
  installing just do systemctl restart jenkins
- Jenkins pipeline when with parameters.
- That means overall we can write CICD for infra also. But in this project we are creating infra in normal way
  like using terraform. We create CICD for only applications like catalogue, shipping etc.
- Before doing CICD for application infra, project infra should be ready.
- What we do in CICD for application infra like catalogue ?
- What does CI part & CD part stages in application like catalogue ?
- What is pipeline utility steps plugin ? To read the Json file.
- Next is installing dependency ? Installing nodejs (From the roboshop documentation) in agent is mandatory
  in order to install npm dependency.
- Next zip the above catalogue output code nothing but artifact & store in nexus repository (80801). We use
  Sonatype nexus because it is a widely adopted and reliable artifact repository manager. Create an instance
  with a minimum of 2GB RAM & 30GB storage (t3.medium). While the actual installation is typically handled by
  the SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) team, it's important to understand the concept. Dont worry about
  installation or updates. What is internal YUM repositories ? This is why Nexus acts as a central point â€” not
  only for storing build artifacts but also for serving as a local repository for all required libraries and
  dependencies.
- Now create a cataloge repository to hold the catalogue artifacts using "maven2 hosted" format. What is
  maven2 hosted format ? It is popular format, used for maintaining application artifacts in unique way. Group
  id ---> com.roboshop, artifact id ---> catalogue, version ---> 1.0.0. Folder structure be like
  com/roboshop/catalogue/version
- We have version policy Release (Prod), Snapshot (Dev), Mixed (Both)
- Allow redeploy in Deployment policy because we are in dev.
- Now we get URL of that repository.
- Remove workspace directory after pipeline success.
