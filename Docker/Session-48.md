### Overview of previous sessions
- We learned linux and how to use linux commands.
- Configured the project manually.
- We automated (or) configured the project using shellscript.
- We automated (or) configured the project using ansible also.
- Then created infrastructure using terraform.
- Infrastructure using terraform + Jenkins CICD for apps + we installed applications.
- Finally we deployed into the VMs in AWS cloud (Like EC2 is nothing but a VM)
- That means till now our applications are deployed into VM based.
- From this session, we are going to deploy applications in Docker & Containerization.

### Containerization
Containerization is a lightweight form of virtualization (VM) that involves packaging an application and all its dependencies (like libraries, configuration files, and binaries) into a single, self-contained unit called a container. This allows the application to run consistently across different environments from a developer's laptop to test environments to production servers. How the world evolved from past is the below example.
Physical severs ---> Virtualization VM ---> Containerization
