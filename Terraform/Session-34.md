### Creating resources in "Robosho-terraform"
- 01-vpc
- 02-sg
- 03-vpn
- 04-ec2
Go through above all in VS.












### Points to remember
- We know how to develop the module and how to use the module
- SSM Parameter is to store the configuration, for example one project exports config, another one refers.
- Mostly in the companies, errors are not because of coding, it is because of configuration change, even if we
  make small changes in configuration, we get errors, so thats why we need to keep config independently.
- SG is very important because to connect every resources in aws we need SG.
