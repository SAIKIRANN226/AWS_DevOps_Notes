Start a project "Roboshop-infra-Dev" in VS, this is for Dev environment, as this is multi-env, you have three options like Tfvars-method, Workspaces-method and different repos for different env's, present siva is now creating different folders for different env's. Every method has pros and cons, you can tell this in interview. We also need to create for Sit,Uat,Prod also. So any project starts with VPC, so create vpc first.
