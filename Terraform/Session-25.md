# Terraform is a popular Infrastructure as code (IaC)
Terraform is an open-source tool developed by HashiCorp. Instead of going into AWS console and manually creating an EC2 instance or any other resources, we can create by writing terraform code. In olden days people used "CFengine" and rightnow people are using chef, puppet, ansible, terraform etc. Till now we configured our project manually, also using shellscript, ansible, but we prefer ansible as a configuration management if it is large project. Because ansible can connect to more number of servers easily from one single ansible server, we can also call controller machine. Why we din't prefer manual configuration ? Because manually logging in every servers is a timetaking process and also we get more human errors.
